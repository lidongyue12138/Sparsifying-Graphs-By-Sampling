### learnable LPA
Use the first part of GCN-LPA, an end-to-end model that unifies Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) and Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) for adaptive semi-supervised node classification, proposed by Hongwei Wang and Jure Leskovec in the paper <Unifying Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Label Propagation>.

### Running the code

```
$ python main.py
```
**Note**: The default dataset is Citeseer.
Hyper-parameter settings for other datasets are provided in ``main.py``.
